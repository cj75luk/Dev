Product Description
-------------------
The Ansible modules for Dell EMC Unity are used to automate and orchestrate the deployment, configuration, and management of Dell EMC Unity Family systems, including Unity, Unity XT, and the UnityVSA. The capabilities of Ansible modules are managing NFS exports, SMB shares, NAS server, File Systems, File System Snapshots, Quota tree, User quotas for filesystem and quota tree and obtaining Unity system information. The options available for each capability are list, show, create, delete, and modify; except for NAS server for which options available are list & modify.

New features & enhancements
---------------------------
This release has the following changes -


- Fixed typo in galaxy.yml
- Updated few samples in modules
- Added dual licensing
- Documentation updates

Known issues
------------
Known issues in this release are listed below:
- Filesystem creation with quota config
    - Setting quota configuration while creating a filesystem may sometime observe delay in fetching the details about the quota config of the new filesystem. The module will throw an error to rerun the task to see expected result.
    
- Mapping and unmapping of hosts for a Consistency group
    - Interoperability between Ansible Unity playbooks and Unisphere REST API is not supported for mapping and unmapping of hosts for a consistency group.
      > **WORKAROUND:** It is recommended to use Ansible Unity modules consistently for all mapping and unmapping of hosts for a consistency group instead of partially/mutually doing it through Unisphere and Ansible modules.

Limitations
